# To do
- **Refactor the code**
	- Annotate/comment the code
	- Higher-level classes (Costume, Sprite, Stage, etc)
		- Switch to a proper request library
	- Deobfuscate compiler
- Abstract away the code generation (maybe with [astring](https://github.com/davidbonnet/astring)?)
	- If rewriting the code generator, implement it to work with .sb3s
- Switch to scratch-svg-renderer
